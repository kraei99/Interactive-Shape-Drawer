Create an interactive program using Python Turtle. Draw a circle with a radius of 80 at (0, 0) in green. Register mouse clicks to erase the circle within its square boundary or draw it at the clicked position outside. Optional: Use PositionService for data management. Consistency in turtle movement is crucial.
